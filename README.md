I completed the internship in Operations Research held in June and July 2024.
Let me introduce 3 projects from there:

**1. next best offer**
- branch & industry: marketing in banking
- keywords: pyomo solver, linear programming, calibration curve 
- description: we should maximize margin by matching target action (call or sms) and product (credit or credit card) to clients based on their preferences with the limitation on the marketing budget

**2. price optimization**
- branch & industry: marketing in retail 
- keywords: pyomo solver, non linear mixed integer optimization, elasticity based pricing
- description: we should maximize revenue by setting price on 5 products with the limitation on price deviation from seasonal price 

**3. causal inference**
- branch & industry: marketing in fmcg
- keywords: graph theory, nx, greedy equivalence search algorithm
- description: we should investigate causal structures and their robustness on a given dataframe

All data are synthetic.

Enjoy!
