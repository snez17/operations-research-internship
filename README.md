During my Operations Research internship (June-July 2024), I tackled three projects using mathematical modeling and optimization techniques:

**Next Best Offer**: Maximized marketing campaign margin in the banking sector by optimally matching customer actions (call/SMS) and products (credit/credit card) using Pyomo (linear programming) and calibrating results.

**Price Optimization**: Increased revenue for a retail company by setting optimal prices for five products using Pyomo (non-linear mixed-integer optimization) and elasticity-based pricing, while respecting price deviation constraints.

**Causal Inference**: Investigated and analyzed causal structures within a synthetic FMCG dataset using graph theory (NetworkX) and the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm to understand variable relationships and robustness.


All data used were synthetically generated.
